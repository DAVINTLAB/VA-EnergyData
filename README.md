# Visual Analytics System for Energy Data.


Due to the recent technological evolution, new sensors and devices are being incorporated
in buildings and smart cities, to facilitate the understanding of its dynamics and
improve its management, as well as its cost-benefit ratio. In this context, the combination of
information technology and devices capable of capturing and sharing information with other
devices can help to collect and understand energy data. This is an important task to assess
energy efficiency, helping to solve energy-related problems. However, it can become
a challenge to analyze large volumes of data that are collected and stored continuously to
confirm trends, identify hidden patterns and outliers that help in decision making. The use
of graphical representations can assist in this process, but the visual analysis of large volumes
of energy data may not be a simple task to be performed, as many of the existing
visualization tools were not designed for this purpose, making it so difficult for an interactive
analysis with different levels of granularity over time, such as comparing meteorological
data with different energy data. Thus, the objective of this work is to present a model for
visual analysis of consumption data or energy generation for cities and smart buildings. This
model allows to load, analyze and compare energy data and meteorological data over time
to, for example, identify consumption patterns with different climatic conditions and outliers.
In addition, it offers several ways to explore and understand patterns between different sets
of data, incorporates four algorithms to perform predictive analysis and allows to evaluate
data with different levels of time granularities, through an interactive approach based on
the integrated on-demand detail technique com coordinated multiple views. An evaluation
with domain experts demonstrates the feasibility, in addition to the advantages of using this
model to explore, monitor and compare energy data.
